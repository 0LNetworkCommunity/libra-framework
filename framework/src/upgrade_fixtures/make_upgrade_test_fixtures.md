## Upgrade Fixtures
All fixtures needed to test upgrades are generated on the first run of any test
that requires it.

A test will call:
`upgrade_fixtures::testsuite_warmup_fixtures();`

It will only build if there are no such fixtures in the expected path
`framework/src/upgrade_fixtures/fixtures`.

Sometimes if the test aborts the fixtures may be in an incomplete state. So you
can delete the fixtures or generate manually, see below.

## Generate these fixtures manually
Making these fixtures is prone to error, so we have some helpers.

TODO: fixtures should be done pre-test in a build.rs

## TL;DR
```
RUST_MIN_STACK=104857600 cargo t -- make_the_upgrade_fixtures --include-ignored
```

## How the test fixtures work

We want to test that we can modify code in the 0x1 address and upgrade successfully.

To do this we will create a framework upgrade script for MoveStdlib. We will add
a module and function that would not otherwise not be there;
"all_your_base.move". That way after the upgrade, when we call that function we
get a result, instead of an abort (in the case of an upgrade not being successful).

```

module std::all_your_base {
  #[view]
  public fun are_belong_to(): vector<u8> {
    b"us"
  }
}
```

#### 1.Run the test: make_the_upgrade_fixtures()
This will copy the `all_your_base.move` temporarily to file to `./framework/move-stdlib`. It will then compile the artifacts and later remove the file.


The interface is just using cargo test. We need to also increase the stack size, because often it overflows. We have a makefile hack for this.

```
	RUST_MIN_STACK=104857600 cargo t -- make_the_upgrade_fixtures --include-ignored
```

Theres a makefile for this

```
make upgrade_fixtures
```

#### 2. Check files
If everything went well you'll have a `script.mv` and a `script_sha3` file here. The script_sha3 should be a different hash that you've had before if there are any changes to the MoveStdlib.

#### 3. Run the test
Any test that call the newly deployed view function which should return hex
enconded "us", which is "0x7573".
