  /// pledged coins, and unlocked circulation.

  /// # Returns
  ///
  /// A tuple containing five values:
  /// * `total`: The total supply of Libra Coin in existence
  /// * `slow_locked`: Amount of coins locked in slow wallets
  /// * `donor_voice`: Coins allocated to community endowments via donor voice
  /// * `pledge`: Coins committed to future pledges
  /// * `unlocked`: Total coins that have been unlocked from slow wallets and are in circulation
  ///
  /// Note: Since v8, the system assumes all coins are initially locked, and this
  /// function calculates the unlocked supply based on transfers out of slow wallets
  /// and community wallets.
