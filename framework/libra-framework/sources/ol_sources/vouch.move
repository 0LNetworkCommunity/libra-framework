        Anti-Sybil Protection:

        The vouch system needs protection against sybil attack vectors. A malicious actor could:
        1. Obtain vouches from honest users
        2. Use those vouches to create many sybil identities by quickly vouching for and revoking from
           accounts they control
        3. Use these identities to gain undue influence (e.g., for Founder status)

        To prevent this, we implement:
        - A limit on revocations per epoch
        - A cooldown period after revocation before new vouches can be given
        - Lifetime tracking of vouching activity

        This ensures that even if a malicious user receives multiple valid vouches, they cannot
        rapidly reuse those vouches to create many sybil identities.
