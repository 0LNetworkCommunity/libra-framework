/// OL relies on a social graph, and proactive "vouching" of human-operated
/// accounts as part of its sybil-resistance strategy.
/// This is intentional. In all crypto economic systems there is a blend of relationship
/// and economic guarantees. In OL we experiment in both domains, sometimes leaning
/// more explicitly on relationships (as other protocols may do this tacitly).
///
/// As such our relationship games would ideally use classic graph algorithms for community detection.
/// However the state available on the Move virtual machine is very limited. As such
/// we rely mostly on ancestry of lineages of account (ancestry.move), together with scoring
/// of the degree of relationships.
///
/// This approach however relies on always crawling the graph from a root of trust. This implies three
/// minimal goals for the software
/// 1. Scoring connections to a root of trust.
/// The software below, allows users to score a participant's connection to an arbitrary, user-defined
/// root of trust.
/// 2. Rotating Root of Trust
/// However not implemented in the protocol was a way to rotate this root of trust (up to V7).
/// This module now proposes a method of rotating root of trues
/// 3. Proposing a default root of trust.
/// This module sets a reasonable root of trust for a number of games
/// played in OL. It is not the only root of trust, and neither is it static.
/// Previously the Validator qualification game, had these functions built in using the (vouch.move).
/// For validators the root of trust was presumed to be the Genesis validator set. This source does not change that policy: it commences a default root of trust based on that genesis validator set, and with #2 above allows for the rotation of that root of trust.
/// There are a number of ways of instantiating and updating roots of trust,
/// this module is agnostic to the method of instantiation, besides providing
/// a transition from how it was implemented prior to V8.
/// It's expected that there will be experimentation in the rotating and
/// and selecting of roots of trust. For now this module is agnostic,
/// understanding the relationship building happens off-chain.
