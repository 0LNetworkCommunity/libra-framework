/// Periodically, Donor Voice accounts, (a.k.a Community Wallets) must
/// be re-authorized by their donors. See docs in donor_voice.move for more details.
///
/// Why this matters:
/// Community wallets are intended to be active participants in the ecosystem, consistently
/// executing their programs and supporting their causes. However, over time, some community
/// wallets may become dormant due to various reasons: loss of interest, departure of key
/// stakeholders, or simply being forgotten. This reauthorization mechanism creates a protocol
/// to periodically validate that community wallets are still actively managed, requiring
/// explicit reauthorization every 5 years, or after 1 year of complete inactivity. This
/// ensures funds are not locked indefinitely in abandoned wallets and provides donors with
/// confidence that their contributions remain under proper governance and stewardship.
