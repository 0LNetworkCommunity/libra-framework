      /// There are examples on how to do this in BinaryBallot, and MultiSig.
      /// All methods are restricted by the ability to aquire the BallotTracker and Ballots, and also the Owner's GUID CreateCapability (which can be moved into a struct so that it can be accessed programatically outside of owner transactions, see MultiSig as an example).
      /// The actual logic of what happens when a ballot passes, exists outside of this module. That is, there are no "tally" methods here.
      /// There are no handlers here either, your library needs to handle the result of a transaction and a vote outcome.

      /// Developers may simply initialize a poll struct at the root level of their address, and include a field for BallotTracker (see BinaryBallot as an example).

      /// Design:
      /// VoteLib is only opinionated as to the possible status of Ballots: Pending, Approved, Rejected.

      /// Every Ballot has a minimalist set fields properties: GUID and whether it is completed.
      // What is powerful (and initially confusing) is that every Ballot has also has a storage field for a generic. So you can pass specific TallyType data into the Ballot.
      /// Examples of data include: what fields do you need for polling? Is is a simple counter of approve, reject, or do we need more fields (like a vector of addresses that voted yes). This library is unopinionated.

      /// In that generic for TallyType, one can also nest a separate Struct with, and so on, like russian dolls. But in practice inside a TallyType you may want to add data for this ballots "issue" at hand, so that it can be programattically accessed by a handler. I.e. in a multisig case: You can have TallyType<PaymentInstruction> { addresses_in_favor: vector<address>, issue: PaymentInstruction }. Which in itself is PaymentInstruction { amount: u64, payee: address }.

      /// Note to devs new to Move. Because of how Move language works, you are not able to mutate the Ballot type in a third party module. But there isn't much to do on it anyway, only mark it "completed". And there is a method for that.
      /// What you may initially struggle with is the TallyType cannot be modified in this library, it must be mutated in the Library that defines your TallyType (see BinaryBallot). So you should borrow a mutable reference of the TallyType with get_type_struct_mut(), and then mutate it in your contract.
