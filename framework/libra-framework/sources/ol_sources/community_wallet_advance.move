// Community wallet advance module
// Ordinarily community wallets can only send
// funds to slow wallets. This means they don't have
// liquid and unlocked tokens. This was intended to
// prevent sybil attacks and other forms of abuse.
// However, there are cases where a community wallet's
// program may need liquid funds.

// This experimental feature would allow a community wallet
// to unlock tokens for sending to ordinary wallets, but only as a loan.
// It needs to be repaid within a certain time frame, or the community wallet
// will be disabled (and require re-authorization by the donors).
// Additionally, new donations to the community wallet, first go into servicing
// the loan.
// Last, there's a yearly limit of X% of the balance which the community wallet
// can loan out.

// In the design below, the Loan information is stored in the framework 0x1 account, however the coins are kept in the account state, and must be authorized with a withdraw capability.
