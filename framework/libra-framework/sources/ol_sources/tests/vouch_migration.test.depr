/*

  This test is to ensure that the migration of vouches
  from legacy to new validators is working as expected.

  1. Legacy data:
    - alice vouches for bob
    - carol vouches for bob
    - alice vouches for carol
  2. New data:
    - dave vouches for eve
    - eve vouches for frank

  trigger epoch to execute migration
  - check migrated vals vouches
