  /*
    Founder Status

    The founder status is a special designation that identifies pre-v8 accounts that have established
    a web of trust with other users. This is critical for anti-sybil security, as it helps verify
    that accounts are operated by real human users rather than bots or sock puppet accounts.

    By requiring a minimum trust score (implemented in page_rank_lazy.move), the system can ensure
    that an account has meaningful connections with other accounts in the network. This is done by:

    1. Calculating the trust score based on the account's position in the network graph
    2. Checking if this score exceeds the threshold defined by MULTIPLIER
    3. Only setting founder status as "has_human_friends" when this threshold is met

    This works in conjunction with the anti-sybil protections in vouch.move, which prevent
    rapid vouching and revoking to create fake identities.
