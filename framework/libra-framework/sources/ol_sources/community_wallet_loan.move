/// Community wallet loan module
/// Ordinarily community wallets can only send
/// funds to slow wallets. This means they don't have
/// liquid and unlocked tokens. This was intended to
/// prevent sybil attacks and other forms of abuse.
/// However, there are cases where a community wallet's
/// program may need liquid funds.

/// This experimental feature would allow a community wallet
/// to unlock tokens for sending to ordinary wallets, but only as a loan.
/// It needs to be repaid within a certain time frame, or the community wallet
/// will be disabled (and require re-authorization by the donors).
/// Additionally, new donations to the community wallet, first go into servicing
/// the loan.
/// Last, there's a yearly limit of X% of the balance which the community wallet
/// can loan out.
