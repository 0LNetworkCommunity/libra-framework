/*
  Vouch Metrics Module

  This module provides pure utility functions for calculating vouch quality metrics
  without directly accessing vouch data. This avoids circular dependencies between modules.

  The module only contains stateless helper functions that can be used by both
  vouch.move and founder.move without creating dependency cycles.
