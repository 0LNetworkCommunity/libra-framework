# Key Rotation
> CAUTION: Please read carefully and ensure you understand these instructions. Rotating the wrong key could lock you out of your account and make funds permanently inaccessible.

There are two cases:

1) You are in full control of an account and would like to rotate to a new private key (using a new mnemonic).

This is a single step, and you can simply use the current mnemonic to sign a transaction and the new mnemonic to sign a rotation proof.

2) You are claiming an account from someone else.

This requires two steps where the current owner (Alice) will first authorize an existing account of the new owner (Bob) to rotate keys for the account being claimed. Bob will have two accounts at the end of the process, and the prior owner, Alice, will have none.

## CASE 1: Rotate Keys on Your Wallet

You will be prompted for a mnemonic twice. But these should be DIFFERENT mnemonics.

The first mnemonic is for your current credentials which will be deprecated. It is used to sign and send the rotation transaction to the blockchain.

In the process, you will be prompted for the NEW mnemonic you would like to be using going forward.

Additionally, you can expect the CLI tool to ask you to confirm this operation twice in the process.

```bash
libra txs user rotate-key
```

Note: If you have an advanced case and would like to submit the private key itself, see below.

## CASE 2: Claim an account

There are two steps involved in claiming another account. First, some definitions:
- There are two parties Original Owner (Alice, for example) and New Owner (Bob).

- Alice is offering the Claimed Account (`0x123`) to Bob.

- Bob must already have a separate Delegate Account on-chain (`0x456`). The only reason for this is that Bob needs to do some sensitive signing of keys and submit it to the chain, and there's no way for Alice or really anyone else to do this for him.

- Bob will also require a New Mnemonic, which he will use to control the Claimed Account in the future.

With all that in place:

#### Original Owner Alice's Job

Alice will send a transaction to "delegate" Bob's account `0x456` with the power to rotate the keys to `0x123`.

Alice's job ends here.

#### New Owner Bob's Job

Next, Bob needs his usual credentials for `0x456`, and also the New Mnemonic he plans to use for `0x123`.

He submits a transaction (after a bit of processing of the New Mnemonic private keys), which should successfully rotate the keys to `0x123`.

The job of the Delegate account `0x456` is over (the account could even be disposed of).

## Step 1: Original Owner Delegates Rotation Capability
Grant another user the capability to change the Authentication Key for a specified address. You will be prompted to enter the mnemonic for the address whose authentication key will be changed:

```bash
libra txs user rotation-capability --delegate-address <DELEGATE_ADDRESS>
```

The specified delegate address can now rotate authentication keys on the address for which the mnemonic was provided.

## Step 2: New Owner Rotates Authentication Keys Using the Delegated Address
Enables a delegated user to rotate the Authentication Key for a specified wallet address:

```bash
libra txs user rotate-key --claim-address <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
```

# Cheat Sheet

### Create a new mnemonic
```
libra wallet keygen
```

# Advanced: Optionally Input the Private Key
To recover a private key using a mnemonic, use:

```bash
libra wallet keygen --mnemonic <MNEMONIC> --output-dir <OUTPUT_DIR>
```

Your private key will be stored in a file called `private_keys.yaml` in the directory you specified above. Specifically, it's called `account_private_key`. The private key corresponds with the `account_address` above it.

Once you have a private key, you can submit the transaction by explicitly setting the key. In this case, the new mnemonic will not be asked for.

```bash
libra txs user rotate-key --new-private-key <NEW_PRIVATE_KEY> --claim-address <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
```
